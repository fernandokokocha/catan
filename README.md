### Catan - The Settlers of Catan in Ruby TDD

### Short timeline

1. Started in March 2015 in TDD
2. Abandoned in June 2015
3. Long, long break. No particular reason for that.
4. Picked up again in September 2018 as a cool way of imitating legacy code (I did learn a lot in the meantime)

### Requirements

#### Ruby

No particular version is required. Works fine for 2.4.1, although started for some earlier version.

#### Rspec

No particular version is required. Works fine for 3.7, although started for some earlier version.

### Run tests

Issue `rspec` in the root directory.
