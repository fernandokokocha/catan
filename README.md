# Catan - The Settlers of Catan in Ruby TDD

## Short timeline

1. Started in March 2015 in TDD
2. Abandoned in June 2015
3. Long, long break. No particular reason for that.
4. Picked up again in September 2018 as a cool way of imitating legacy code (I did learn a lot in the meantime)

## Requirements

For usage:
* Ruby 2.4.1

For development (see `catan.gemspec`):
* RSpec 3.7
* Rubocop 0.62
* overcommit 0.46

Overcommit tool uses Rubocop and RSpec on the adequate development phases. There's no need for additional configuration on your side.

## Test

Issue `rspec` in the root directory.

## RuboCop

Issue `rubocop` in the root directory.
